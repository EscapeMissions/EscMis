    <h2>Nicene Creed</h2>
    <p>
      
We believe in one God,<br>
the Father, the almighty,<br>
maker of heaven and earth,<br>
of all that is,<br>
seen and unseen. <br><br>
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br>
the only Son of God,<br>
eternally begotten of the Father,<br>
God from God, Light from Light,<br>
true God from true God,<br>
begotten, not made,<br>
of one being with the Father.<br>
Through him all things were made.<br><br>
For us men and for our salvation<br>
he came down from heaven;<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and was made man.<br><br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br><br>
He will come again in glory<br>
to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.<br><br>
We believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br>
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>
and the life of the world to come. <br><br>Amen.
