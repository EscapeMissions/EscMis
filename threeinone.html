    <h2>Three In One</h2>
    <p>
<b>Family Worship:</b><br>
Home, home, sweet home. Family is God’s sacred design, and it is where faith is best passed on to the next generation. Parents are called not only to feed their children with food but also to nourish them with God’s Word. Guide your children to know and love God. 
Reading the Bible together is a wonderful habit. I love to do it every day with mine. But if you want to engage your children in a fun, interactive way—helping them memorize Scripture while learning about creation care—we recommend the <em>Escape Missions</em> book series. Each book unfolds like an exciting escape-room adventure, guiding your family into God’s Word and the wonders of His creation.

<br><br><b>Children’s Ministry Add-On: </b><br>
The <em>Escape Missions</em> book series is an excellent complement to any children’s ministry curriculum. Case studies have shown how children aged 8–12 embraced it with joy and eagerly looked forward to the next <em>Escape Missions</em> gathering.

This resource is fun, educational, Scripture-focused, and deeply engaging. If you are a church leader or children’s ministry pastor, I highly recommend giving it a try. You and the children will embark on a creation-care escape-room adventure. An ultimate experience filled with wonder, Scripture learning, exploring nature and plenty of fun!

<br><br><b>Intergenerational Activity: </b> <br>
Intergenerational church is a growing movement, and more resources are needed to support this meaningful trend. If you are planning an event and want an activity that brings all ages together, the <em>Escape Missions</em> book series is a wonderful choice.

Each book includes thoughtfully prepared discussion questions tailored for different age groups, making it easy for everyone to participate—children, youth, adults, and seniors. It’s an opportunity to play, learn, and grow together in God’s Word. Don’t forget the theme-based free worksheets for young children. All ages are welcome!
